how to trace IRC: 

disable the modes that are set in your own IRC channel. Type 
    <code>/mode #Faded -CMmnt</code>
    <code>.cmd ss -n</code>

if you want to use netstat (could possibly crash IRC) but it's mostly for the windows bots type in 
    <code>.cmd netstat -n</code>

a list of IPs will show them connected to them always think the easiest port beside the irc <code><IP.ADDR>:6667</code> if its a <code>(x.x.x.x:1111)</code> 4x4 IP to Port then most likely its an IRC.

after finding IRC's reset the modes in your own IRC channel. type 
    <code>/mode #Faded +CMmnt</code>

when you're done remember to type 
    <code>.ud.server <IP_PORT></code> 

this will make a channel on your own IRC with the same name as from the channel you're jacking the bots from
